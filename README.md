## 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

> **Tic-Tac-Toe** is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking X or O in a 3×3 grid.
> The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
> It's a fun and easy game that helps improve logical thinking and strategy skills.

This  simple project was developed as part of a hands-on session in our college **Data Club**, guided by our seniors. It was an engaging way to learn the basics of web development and game logic.
